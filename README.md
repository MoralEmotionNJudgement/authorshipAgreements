# Authorship Agreements
Here are some materials for talking about how to negotatiate authorship for the projects of the Lab. All of them are variations of some taxonomy to contrbutorship weighed by importance. The most influential seems to be The [CRediT Taxonomy](https://casrai.org/credit/), part of the article Sam shared [with us] (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01574-y?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=2b57b71093-briefing-dy-20210615&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-2b57b71093-46406810). This taxonomy includes 14 roles, some of them not directly relevant fot the stuff we do (say validation or visualization as a central part of a project). 

Variations in the APA flavor are the (in)famous scorecards both for [authorship credit](authorship-determination-scorecard.pdf) and to decide how to ["untie"](authorship-tie-breaker-scorecard.pdf). The basic principle is that any kind of writing has a larger weight than other associated tasks but this is something up for discussion in our case. 

The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is running massive online collaboration projects where awarding authorship can be tricky. For this, each project has its own agreement [example](PSA-DM001 Collaboration Agreement (1).docx) based on the CRediT system. The interesting thing about this is that accepting an invitation to collaborate implies accepting these guidelines.

Lastly, yes, there is a [ShinyApp](https://martonbalazskovacs.shinyapps.io/tenzing/) to produce this information from R!
